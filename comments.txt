here are the instructions on how to use and verify the functions of the household builder form.

1. you must enter a numerical age that is greater than 0. if try to enter something other than numbers it 
  will not let you. if you enter a negative number it will allow you to enter the number but it wont let you 
  add or submit the person to the household builder list.

2. you must choose a relationship from the drop down list. if you don't choose a relationship it will not 
  let you add or submit

3. you must choose if the person is a smoker or nonsmoker. although you do not have to select a choice 
  please choose one. it will help with later retrieval and modifications.

4. clicking <add> button will the person to a newly created list at the top of the form. the person will
   be displayed in JSON format.

5. you can now go back to age, relationship, and smoking/nonsmoking and <add> another person. keep adding people 
  until you have all of the family members. make sure you mark  age, relationship, and smoking/nonsmoking for 
  every family member.

6. you should have a list of all of the family members at the  top of the form. review the list for any mistakes.
  if there are mistakes or you want to remove a family member you can do so by. entering the person's 
  age, relationship, and smoking/nonsmoking status the click <remove> button. you should no longer see 
  the person listed at the top, the person has successfully been removed. if you still see their info on this list 
  check to make sure that you've exactly matched the age, relationship, and smoker/nonsmoker status the click <remove>
  button again.

7. if there are more than 1 person to remove, repeat step 6 making sure to click <remove> after each person. 

8. once you are satisfied with the list click on the <submit> button and the family list at the top will disappear
  you will see a "to server" array below the submit button it should now contain an array of the family
  members within the "to server" array. 

9. now you are ready to enter a different family by repeating step 5 and 6 or you can retrieve the last 
  family in the server by clicking on the <retrieve last> button. if you click on the <retrieve last> button 
  the very group of family members will be listed at the top of the form and you can add or remove family members 
  and submit again. any changes made will be updated in the server after <submit> is clicked.

10. if there are several families stored in the server and you want to get to someone other than the very 
  last family. (that's beyond the scope of this project) but it can be done. you will have to click on <retrieve last>
  once then remove every single family member until there are no one listed on top of the form. then you would click
  <retrieve last> again (only once) it will then list the next-to-last family group. you can remove all family members
  and click <retrieve last> again. you can continue doing this until everyone is deleted.

11. if you have a problem where it will not remove person from list. try clicking <submit> to send to the server then
  <retrieve last> 

12. don't double click <retrieve last> you will list 2 different families at the top of the form and it's not designed to handle 
  2 families merged. everything will get screwed up. (note: it can be programmed to block double clicks, but that's for 
  another day.)
